        <h1>Help</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the help page for <span class="highlight">Join</span>, your guide to using our kanban project
            management tool. Below, we’ll
            provide
            an overview of what <span class="highlight">Join</span> is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.</p>

        <h2>What is Join?</h2>
        <p><span class="highlight">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool developed by a group of
            dedicated students as part of their
            web
            development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p>

        <p>Kanban, meaning "signboard" in Japanese, is a highly efficient approach to visualizing tasks, managing work
            in
            progress, and improving overall productivity. <span class="highlight">Join</span> uses kanban principles to
            help users organize tasks and
            projects using a simple and visual interface.</p>

        <p>Note that <span class="highlight">Join</span> is an educational project, not intended for extensive business
            use. While we aim to provide
            the
            best experience, we cannot guarantee full availability, reliability, or accuracy regarding Join’s
            functionality.

        <h2>How to Use <span class="highlight">Join</span></h2>
        <p>Follow these steps to start using <span class="highlight">Join</span>:</p>

        <h3 class="align">
            <p class="bulletNumbers2">1.</p> Exploring the Board
        </h3>
        <p class="tabAlign">Once logged in, you'll see a default board. This board represents your project, divided into
            four sections:
            "To
            Do", "In Progress", "Await Feedback", and "Done".</p>

        <h3 class="align">
            <p class="bulletNumbers">2.</p> Creating Contacts
        </h3>
        <p class="tabAlign">In <span class="highlight">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your
            projects. Navigate to the "Contacts"
            section, click "New
            Contact", and enter the required details. Once added, these contacts can be assigned to tasks and interact
            with
            the project board.</p>

        <h3 class="align">
            <p class="bulletNumbers">3.</p> Adding Cards
        </h3>
        <p class="tabAlign">After setting up your contacts, you can begin adding cards to represent individual tasks.
            Click the "+"
            button
            under any list to create a new card. You can add task details like name, description, due date, and assign
            contacts to each task.</p>

        <h3 class="align">
            <p class="bulletNumbers">4.</p> Moving Cards
        </h3>
        <p class="tabAlign">As tasks progress, you can move them across lists by dragging and dropping the cards from
            one section to
            another,
            allowing you to visually track the current status of each task.</p>

        <h3 class="align">
            <p class="bulletNumbers">5.</p> Deleting Cards
        </h3>
        <p class="tabAlign">Once a task is finished, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Be cautious
            when deleting
            tasks,
            as this action cannot be undone.</p>

        <p class="tabAlign">To use <span class="highlight">Join</span> effectively, regular updates from you and your
            team are necessary to keep the
            board accurate and
            up
            to date.</p>
